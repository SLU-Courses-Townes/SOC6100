The data are in 5 zipped SAS "transport format" files as follows:

Cite75_99.zip contains the pairwise citations data.
Pat63_99.zip contains the patent data, including the constructed variables
Coname.zip contains the assignee names.
Match.zip contains the match to CUSIP numbers
Inventor.zip contains the individual inventor records

Each of these files has a corresponding "txt" file that contains the variable names and other documentation.
